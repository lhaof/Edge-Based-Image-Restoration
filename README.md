# Edge-Based-Image-Restoration
This is the code of Edge-Based Image Restoration, implemented by lhaof.

If you use this code, you need to cite the following paper
```
@article{article,
  author = {Rares, Andrei and Reinders, Marcel and Biemond, Jan},
  year = {2005},
  month = {01},
  pages = {1454-1468},
  title = {Edge-Based Image Restoration.},
  volume = {14},
  journal = {IEEE Transactions on Image Processing}
}
```
I implemented this code when I was submitting my paper 'CASI: Context-Aware Semantic Inpainting'. Because I was required to compare my work with this algorithm 'Edge-Based Image Restoration'. Anyway, you may kindly cite my work below
```
